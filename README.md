yarn
yarn run dev
```

If you deploy new Candy Machine you can update UI config here: `./src/config/candy-machine.config.js`.

## Style

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) or [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) are selected tools for rapid style development.

You can quickly change theme changing `daisy.themes` within `./tailwind.config.js`.

This app encourage you to use CSS Modules over other style technics (like SASS/LESS, Styled Components, usual CSS).
It have modular nature and supports modern CSS. [Read more on Next.JS site](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support).
Anyway, if you want to connect LESS there is example code in `./next.config.js`
